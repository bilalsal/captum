# Investigating Saturation Effects in Integrated Gradients

## Split IG and Experiment Code
Code for expanded IG can be found here, which is a variant of Captum's Integrated Gradients method that returns gradients along the path from input to baseline.
The experiments which use this to compute Split IG and experiment with this technique on ImageNet classification models can be found in this notebook.
